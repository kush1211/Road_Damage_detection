## üöÄ Project Overview

This project focuses on developing and implementing a robust road damage detection system using the state-of-the-art YOLOv5 object detection model. The primary goal is to automate the process of identifying and classifying different types of road surface defects, thereby significantly improving the efficiency and effectiveness of road maintenance operations. By accurately detecting damage early on, this system can help reduce the need for extensive manual inspections, leading to cost savings and enhanced road safety for commuters.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Real-time Object Detection:** Utilizes the speed and accuracy of YOLOv5 for efficient detection.
* **Multi-Class Damage Classification:** Capable of identifying and classifying various types of road damage (e.g., potholes, cracks, rutting). *(You can list specific damage types if applicable)*
* **High Detection Accuracy:** The model was trained on a substantial dataset of **34,000 images**, ensuring robust performance.
* **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluated using **Intersection over Union (IoU)** as the primary metric to guarantee high detection accuracy.
* **Improved Efficiency:** Automates the damage detection process, reducing the reliance on time-consuming manual inspections.
* **Enhanced Road Safety:** Early detection of road damage allows for timely repairs, contributing to safer road conditions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **YOLOv5:** The core object detection framework.
* **PyTorch:** The deep learning library used for training and inference.
* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **[Add any other relevant libraries or tools, e.g., OpenCV, NumPy, etc.]**

## üíæ Dataset

* A comprehensive dataset consisting of **34,000 images** of various road surfaces with different types of damage.
* The dataset was meticulously curated and annotated to ensure the model learns to accurately identify and classify road defects.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Training and Evaluation

* The YOLOv5 model was trained extensively on the prepared dataset.
* **Intersection over Union (IoU)** was used as the key evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the detected bounding boxes and their overlap with the ground truth annotations.
* Achieving high IoU scores demonstrates the model's ability to precisely locate and identify road damage.

## üéØ Results

* The trained YOLOv5 model demonstrates promising results in accurately detecting and classifying various types of road damage.
* The high IoU achieved during evaluation indicates the model's reliability in real-world applications.
* This automated system has the potential to significantly streamline road maintenance workflows.
